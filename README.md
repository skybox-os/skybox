# SkyboxOS
## What is SkyboxOS?
SkyboxOS is a small operating system that I'm designing. I want to make it different but unique from other operating systems, while having compability.
## How to build?
If you're on a x86 CPU running linux, you don't need to build a new compiler or anything. Just install these packages:
```
grub2
xorriso
```
## How to test it?
I test it on [v86](https://copy.sh/v86).
## Plans
Once I finish and make this operating system complete, I will try to integrate a compiler and an assembler to it, and try to see if I can build SkyboxOS inside SkyboxOS.
For now, I **really** need help with creating a function for running raw machine code in C.
